# simple_guess


## This simple guess game uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.


This game first determines the random number by using Math.random(). The function to do so was put in the body. Each time body was rendered the function went to get a number the computer would hold.  

// then a variable for the user input to be stored created. 

// next the user is told on the page how many attempts they had.

// the logic which compares the user input with the computer number is next. checks the parameters and if they are met then they next portion of the function is carried out.
