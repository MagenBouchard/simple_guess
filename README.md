# simple_guess


## This simple guess game uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.


This game first determines the random number by using Math.random(). The player has ten attempts to guess the correct number. 

Each guess logic checks the number the user inputs agaisnt the random number previously determined. Each check provides feedback to the user. The user input and the computer's number is compated and if the user's number is too high text is dynnamically added to the page to tell the user the number is too high. If the number less then that feedback is provided dynamically as well.

If the user guess and the previously determined number is equal then the text dynamically added to the page lets the user know.
